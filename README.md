Serial-World
============

This program was made because of programming contest from a local computer magazin in 2003.
It made it to the 3. place.

The goal was not to make a complete program in 4 weeks. 
The program has to be runnable and to show the idea of the program. 
And it has to be modular to make changes easy, especially the language part has to be open to put in your own language. 
Another goal was to make the program available for different platforms. 
Therefore I had chosen Delphi/Kylix to program and test on Window with Delphi and with Kylix on Linux. 
Only for this programming I learned enough Delphi and Kylix to make this game.

Delphi and Kylix are no longer around but the program can still be developed with Lazarus. 
Lazarus is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
My program idea for this application was to make a self-study-program for everybody who likes to get 
a better understanding of the "serial port". Of course, It can also be used in schools as a part of a computer course.

The program is made in form of a game. The player takes the role of an Agent and has to solve serveral cases. 
The program is Open Source (GPL2).
